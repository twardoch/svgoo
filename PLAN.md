# PLAN.md

This file provides a detailed plan for the entire svgoo project with checkable tasks.

## Research Summary

Based on comprehensive research of existing SVG optimization tools:

### Key Findings
- **svgo**: Node.js SVG optimizer with plugin architecture, CLI interface, and comprehensive ES2020 support
- **libsvgo**: Dr. JS's fork optimized for bundling with browser/Node.js compatibility  
- **svgop**: Adam's previous wrapper using pkg and QuickJS for standalone binaries
- **osvg**: Alternative Rust implementation using rquickjs with 5.63x performance penalty vs native svgo

### Architecture Decision
svgoo will use **rquickjs** for JavaScript integration, combining:
- Rust core for performance and cross-platform deployment
- QuickJS for svgo JavaScript execution
- Full async Rust integration with ES6 Promise handling
- Flexible data conversion between Rust and JS
- Custom module resolvers and loaders
