# PLAN.md - svgoo Version 1.2.0 MVP

This document outlines the focused plan for svgoo version 1.2.0 - a minimal viable product that provides a stable, well-documented SVG optimization tool compatible with basic svgo usage.

## MVP Scope Definition

### What Version 1.2.0 Will Be
- A stable, single-binary SVG optimizer that works on all major platforms
- Compatible with basic svgo usage patterns (file input/output, stdin/stdout)
- Well-documented with clear installation and usage instructions
- Properly tested with >80% code coverage
- Performance within 3-5x of native svgo (acceptable for most use cases)

### What Version 1.2.0 Will NOT Be
- Full plugin system compatibility (deferred to 2.0)
- Python/C++ bindings (deferred to 2.0)
- Advanced CLI features like watch mode or GUI (future versions)
- 100% feature parity with svgo (focus on 80% most-used features)

## Current State Assessment

### Working Components
- ✅ Basic SVG optimization via embedded svgo JavaScript
- ✅ QuickJS runtime integration functioning
- ✅ CLI with stdin/stdout support
- ✅ Project builds and runs on macOS
- ✅ Test infrastructure in place

### Broken/Incomplete Components
- ❌ Plugin system (threading issues with AsyncRuntime)
- ❌ File I/O in CLI
- ❌ Cross-platform testing
- ❌ Performance optimization
- ❌ Comprehensive documentation
