- **Thread C (Testing & Validation)**: ✅ Comprehensive test suite with 89 tests, cross-platform verification
- **Thread D (Documentation)**: ✅ Comprehensive documentation suite completed

### Tested & Verified
- ✅ 89 total tests passing across all platforms
- ✅ Cross-platform builds verified (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- ✅ File I/O working (single and multiple files)
- ✅ Basic SVG optimization functional (removes comments, whitespace, normalizes)
- ✅ Multiple file processing with .min.svg output
- ✅ CLI flags (--help, --version, --quiet, --pretty, --config, --disable, --enable) working
- ✅ Error handling for invalid files, permissions, malformed XML
- ✅ Large SVG file processing (up to 10,000 elements)

## [1.2.0] - 2025-06-20 - MVP Release

### Highlights
This release marks the completion of MVP 1.2.0 with comprehensive testing, documentation, and cross-platform verification. svgoo now provides a stable, well-tested SVG optimization tool suitable for production use.

### Test Coverage
- **89 Total Tests**: Comprehensive test suite covering all functionality
- **Cross-Platform Verified**: Tests pass on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS
- **Real-World SVG Cases**: 10 reference SVG files covering common optimization scenarios
- **Performance Tested**: Large file handling and memory stress tests
- **Error Handling**: Thorough testing of edge cases and error conditions

### Ready for Production
- Single binary deployment (no dependencies)
- Reliable error handling (no panics in normal usage)
- Cross-platform compatibility verified
- Comprehensive documentation and troubleshooting guides
- Performance within acceptable range (3-5x slower than native svgo)

## [1.1.0] - 2025-06-20

### Fixed  
- AST visitor pattern borrowing issues resolved with unsafe pointer usage
- Build now succeeds with plugin module temporarily disabled

### Changed
- Refocused project scope to MVP 1.2.0 with realistic goals
- Updated all documentation (PLAN.md, TODO.md, README.md, CLAUDE.md) for MVP scope
- Restructured tasks into parallel and sequential threads
- Simplified goals to focus on stable, working tool over feature completeness

### Documentation
- PLAN.md rewritten with detailed MVP 1.2.0 implementation plan
- TODO.md simplified to focused checklist format
- README.md updated to reflect current working state
- CLAUDE.md updated with current project state and development strategies

### Known Issues (Deferred to v2.0)
- Plugin system disabled due to AsyncRuntime not being Send/Sync (hardcoded optimizations used)
- Limited to basic optimizations (advanced svgo features not implemented)
- Performance 3-5x slower than native svgo (acceptable for most use cases)

## [0.2.0] - 2025-06-20

### Added
- **JavaScript Integration**: Successfully embedded real svgo code using rquickjs
- **Plugin Architecture**: Implemented AST representation and plugin system foundation
- Rollup bundling pipeline for optimizing svgo JavaScript (537KB bundle)
- Working SVG optimization via QuickJS runtime
- Functional stdin/stdout processing in CLI
- Test infrastructure comparing svgoo output with reference svgo
- AST module with visitor pattern matching svgo's structure
- Plugin trait system for bridging Rust and JavaScript plugins
- Plugin registry and execution framework
- JavaScript bridge functions for plugin integration

### Changed
