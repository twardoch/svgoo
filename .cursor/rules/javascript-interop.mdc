## QuickJS Integration Architecture (Importance: 85)
The core JavaScript interop layer uses QuickJS to embed and execute svgo's optimization code within a Rust environment. This creates a bridge between the native Rust implementation and the JavaScript SVG processing logic.

Key Components:
- JavaScript code bundling system for packaging svgo
- QuickJS runtime initialization and management
- Bidirectional data transfer between Rust and JavaScript contexts

## SVG Processing Bridge (Importance: 90)
The JavaScript bridge maintains byte-for-byte compatibility with svgo's optimization output while providing native performance through Rust. Core functionality includes:

- SVG data marshaling between Rust and JavaScript
- Optimization configuration parameter mapping 
- Result validation and verification pipeline

## Bundling Strategy (Importance: 75)
JavaScript code packaging approach:
- Single-file bundle containing svgo core optimization logic
- Minimal runtime dependencies for cross-platform deployment
- Isolated JavaScript execution environment

## Planned Implementation Flow
1. QuickJS runtime initialization
2. JavaScript bundle loading and validation
3. Bridge setup for Rust/JavaScript communication
4. SVG data transfer and optimization execution
5. Result extraction and validation
