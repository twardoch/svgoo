# ffi-bindings

The FFI interface design facilitates bidirectional communication between the Rust core library and Python/C++ client applications.

## Core FFI Requirements

### API Compatibility
- Full feature parity required with svgo JavaScript API
- Matching function signatures and parameter types
- Consistent error handling patterns

### Data Marshaling
Business Impact Score: 85
- SVG data transmission between language boundaries
- Optimization configuration object serialization
- Result status and error propagation

### Binding Architecture
Business Impact Score: 90
- Python module exposing svgo-compatible interface
- C++ header/implementation for native integration
- Memory ownership and lifecycle management

### Integration Points
Business Impact Score: 75
- SVG optimization pipeline access
- Configuration validation and normalization
- Progress monitoring and cancellation support

Planned Paths:
```
/src/ffi/
  python/
  cpp/
/bindings/
  python/
  cpp/
```
