# svg-optimization-pipeline

The SVG optimization pipeline consists of two primary layers that must maintain byte-for-byte compatibility with the svgo JavaScript library:

## Integration Layer (Importance: 95)
The core optimization bridge integrates:
- Rust performance layer for SVG parsing and manipulation
- svgo JavaScript optimization code executed via QuickJS embedding
- Transformation pipeline for passing SVG data between layers

## Optimization Flow (Importance: 90)
1. Input SVG parsing in Rust
2. Data structure conversion for JavaScript compatibility 
3. svgo optimization execution in QuickJS sandbox
4. Results transformation back to Rust
5. Output validation against svgo reference implementation

## Transformation Rules (Importance: 85)
- Maintain exact svgo optimization behavior
- Preserve all SVG attributes and structure
- Handle edge cases around whitespace and formatting
- Validate optimization results match reference output

The pipeline architecture prioritizes:
- Strict compatibility with svgo's optimization algorithms
- Clean separation between Rust and JavaScript layers
- Reliable data transformation between environments
- Validation of optimization results

Core optimization logic must be preserved while leveraging Rust's performance benefits for parsing and manipulation tasks.
